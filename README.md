## The is a simple project for my WPA interview!

### About the project
I like basketball, so I built a simple command line program that takes a number from 1 - 100 and give you basic player information.

### How to run:
1.) Build the executable: `go build main.go`
2.) Run the executable and pass in a number 1 - 100 (these are player IDs): `./main <MY NUMBER>`

## Example output:
```bash
$ ./main 99
> First Name:  Solomon Last Name:  Hill College:  Arizona Country:  USA 
```
